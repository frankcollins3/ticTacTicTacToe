Unrelated, but had taken a moment away to prepare a journal-based website.
There aren't consistent commits on this, given that it was an exercise of applying themes to a past.
With sockApronSlippers uploaded, and 1 more simple upload to do, the commit system will be adhered to.
Take frequent breaks if you play the game!
